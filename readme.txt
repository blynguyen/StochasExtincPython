â€¢	Models the ecological relationship between predator and prey utilizing differential 
equations and transition diagrams/rates to illustrate discrete changes in population and how 
changes in population can affect the other. Also includes a switch mechanism to model the risk 
of a contagion in relation to population level through transition diagrams. This project 
illustrates the capacity to model complex mathematical and statistical processes within Python, 
the capacity to illustrate the data utilizing graphs, and conveys knowledge of scripting within 
a Jupyter notebook setting.
